### ***The Boy Scout Rule: Leave every space better than you found it.***

A shared workshop works best when everyone takes responsibility for keeping it clean, safe, and ready for the next person. These guidelines ensure that tools, machines, and spaces remain usable for all members.

- **Think of the next member** who will use the space.

## General Guidelines

1. **Gather your tools**
   Before starting any work, take stock if all the cleaning supplies and tools are available for the job.   

2. **Tidy as you go.**  
   Do not wait until the end of your project to start cleaningâ€”wipe, sweep, and organize as you work.

3. **Finish with a reset.**  
   When you are done, reset the space so that it is ready for the next member to use.
   Leave it better than you found it.
   Think of the next member who will use the space.

4. **Take personal items home.**  
   Projects, scrap materials, or personal belongings must be placed in the assigned member box or taken home.

5. **Respect shared resources.**
   Return all tools to their designated storage location.
