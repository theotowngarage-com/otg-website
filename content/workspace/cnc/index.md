## Workflow

1. Design your part in CAD software (e.g., Fusion 360, FreeCAD, or SolidWorks).
2. Create toolpaths in CAM software (e.g., Fusion 360 CAM, VCarve, EstlCAM).
3. Export G-code for the Stepcraft controller.
4. Secure your material on the CNC bed with screws. Make sure that screws do not go through sacrificial fiber-wood board.
5. Install the correct bit, set zero points, and check clearance.
6. Run a simulation and test cut before full operation.

## Safety & Best Practices

- Always wear safety glasses and ear protection.
- Make sure material is clamped firmly to avoid shifting.
- Stand clear of the spindle path during operation.
- Never leave the machine unattended while running.
- Clean chips and dust after each session using the vacuum system.

## Additional Tools & Equipment

- Collets and bit set (end mills, V-bits, ball nose, etc.)
- Calipers for measurement
- Clamps and hold-down fixtures
- Dust extraction system
- Lubricant for metal machining (if required)
