### Workflow

1. Design your part in CAD software (e.g., Fusion 360, FreeCAD, or SolidWorks).
2. Create toolpaths in CAM software (e.g., Fusion 360 CAM, VCarve, EstlCAM).
3. Export G-code for the Stepcraft controller.
4. Secure your material on the CNC bed with screws. Make sure that screws do not go through sacrificial fiber-wood board.
5. Install the correct bit, set zero points, and check clearance.
6. Run a simulation and test cut before full operation.


### Safety & Best Practices

- Always wear safety glasses and ear protection.
- Make sure material is clamped firmly to avoid shifting.
- Stand clear of the spindle path during operation.
- Never leave the machine unattended while running.
- Clean chips and dust after each session using the vacuum system.


### Additional Tools & Equipment

- Collets and bit set (end mills, V-bits, ball nose, etc.)
- Calipers for measurement
- Hold-down fixtures with screws and glue tape
- Vacuum cleaner
- Spray bottle for lubricating while cutting metals


### Getting Started

New members must complete an introduction to the CNC machine before use. This training covers CAD/CAM basics, machine setup, tool changing, and safety procedures.
