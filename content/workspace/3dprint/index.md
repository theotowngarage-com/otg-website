## Supported Materials

If you are new to 3D printing, we recommend to use PLA. We have a lot of colors you can start to play with. For any other material, we assume that you know what you are doing and can take care of simple maintenance of the 3D printer.

- PLA (various colors)
- PETG
- ABS (with supervision and ventilation)
- Flexible filaments (on approved machines)

## Workflow

1. Prepare your model using slicing software (e.g., PrusaSlicer or Cura).
2. Save the G-code to an SD card or upload via USB (depending on printer).
3. Reserve and set up your printer.
4. Monitor your print and clean up the workspace after use.

## Additional Tools & Equipment

- Calipers and rulers for measurement
- Deburring tools and pliers for part cleanup
- Sandpaper and files for finishing
- Glue sticks and adhesives for bed adhesion support

---

## Safety & Best Practices

- Never leave printers unattended for extended periods.
- Use ventilation when printing ABS or other strong-smelling filaments.
- Allow hotend and heated bed to cool before removing prints.
- Keep the lab tidy and report any printer issues to staff or experienced members.
