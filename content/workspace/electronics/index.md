- Micro controllers (ESP32, STM32, RP2040, NRF52, etc.)
- Sensors (hobby and industrial)
- Motors (servo, DC, stepper, etc.)
- Debug tools (4 Channel 100Mhz oscilloscope, logic analyzers, etc.)
- SMD (components & tools)
- Soldering irons, hot air station
- Bench power supplies
- SMD desoldering station with hot plate
- Stereo microscope for micro soldering
- Spot welder for battery packs
