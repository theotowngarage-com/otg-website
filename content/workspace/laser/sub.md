### Workflow

1. Prepare your design in vector software (e.g., Inkscape, Illustrator, CorelDRAW).
2. Export to the required file format (usually `.dxf` or `.svg`).
3. Use the dedicated laptop in the makerspace with Lightburn license to prepare your design for cutting.
4. Load material securely on the cutting bed.
5. Configure power, speed, and focus settings according to the material.
6. Run a small test cut before starting the full job.


### Safety & Best Practices

- Never leave the laser cutter unattended while operating.
- Always turn on the exhaust ventilation before starting a job.
- Ensure materials are approved and free of toxic coatings.
- Keep a fire extinguisher nearby and know where the emergency stop button is.
- Clean the work area after use.
- Place leftover scrap materials in the assigned containers, next to the laser cutter.


### Additional Tools & Equipment

- Calipers and rulers for precise measurement
- Tape and clamps for material positioning
- Air assist system for clean cuts
- Computer workstation with design software
