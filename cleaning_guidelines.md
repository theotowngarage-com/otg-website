# Workshop Cleanliness Guidelines  
*Based on the Boy Scout Rule: Leave every space better than you found it.*

A shared workshop works best when everyone takes responsibility for keeping it clean, safe, and ready for the next person. These guidelines ensure that tools, machines, and spaces remain usable for all members.

## Core Philosophy
- **Leave it better than you found it.**
- **Respect shared resources.**
- **Think of the next member** who will use the space.

---

## General Guidelines
1. **Tidy as you go.**  
   Do not wait until the end of your project to start cleaning—wipe, sweep, and organize as you work.

2. **Finish with a reset.**  
   When you are done, reset the space so that it looks ready for the next member.

3. **Take personal items home.**  
   Do not leave projects, scrap, or personal belongings lying around unless you have arranged approved storage.

## Tools & Equipment
- Return all tools to their **designated storage location**.  
- **Inspect tools** after use—if something is damaged, label it and notify the group.  
- Do not leave tools or machines in a state that makes them unsafe or unusable.  

---

## Workbenches & Surfaces
- Clear all debris, scraps, and materials.  
- Wipe down surfaces so they are free of dust, glue, paint, or oil.  
- Ensure clamps, jigs, and accessories are stored properly.

## Floors & Shared Areas
- Sweep up dust, shavings, and debris immediately after use.  
- Do not leave power cords or trip hazards across walkways.  
- Dispose of waste in the proper bins (general waste, recycling, scrap wood, etc.).  

---

## Materials & Consumables
- Store leftover materials in the proper racks, bins, or shelves.  
- Do not claim or hoard shared supplies—leave them available for all.  
- If you use the last of a shared consumable (sandpaper, glue, screws, etc.), note it on the supplies board or notify the group.  

---

## Safety & Hazardous Materials
- Clean spills immediately (oil, paint, resin, etc.).  
- Label any hazardous material you are storing.  
- Dispose of chemicals, solvents, and sharps according to posted rules.  

---

## Projects in Progress
- If leaving a project in the shop (with approval), store it neatly in the designated project storage area.  
- Clearly **label your project** with your name and date.  
- Projects left in unauthorized spaces may be moved or discarded.

## End-of-Day Checklist
- Tools back in place  
- Surfaces wiped down  
- Floors swept  
- Trash emptied if full  
- Lights off and machines powered down

## Final Reminder
A clean workshop is safer, more productive, and more enjoyable for everyone. Following these rules is part of being a good member of the community.  
**Leave it better than you found it.**
