# Workshop Cleanliness Guidelines  
*Based on the Boy Scout Rule: Leave every space better than you found it.*

A shared workshop works best when everyone takes responsibility for keeping it clean, safe, and ready for the next person. These guidelines ensure that tools, machines, and spaces remain usable for all members.

---

## Core Philosophy
- **Leave it better than you found it.**
- **Respect shared resources.**
- **Think of the next member** who will use the space.

---

## General Guidelines
1. **Tidy as you go.**  
   Do not wait until the end of your project to start cleaning—wipe, sweep, and organize as you work.

2. **Finish with a reset.**  
   When you are done, reset the space so that it is ready for the next member to use.

3. **Take personal items home.**  
   Projects, scrap materials, or personal belongings must be placed in the assigned member box or taken home.

## Tools & Equipment
- Return all tools to their **designated storage location**.  
- **Inspect tools** after use—if something is damaged, label it and notify the group.  
- Do not leave tools or machines in a state that makes them unsafe or unusable.
- Attach and use vacuum with the tools that have an attachment hole
- Vacuum the surroundings immediately after finishing work 
- Use the **appropriately dedicated** workspace for the job (wood in wood workshop; metal in metal workshop etc.)
- Leave tools and machines in a safe and usable state.

## Workbenches & Surfaces
- Clear all debris, scraps, and materials.  
- Wipe down surfaces so they are free of dust, glue, paint, or oil.  
- Ensure clamps, jigs, and accessories are stored properly.  

---

## Floors & Shared Areas
- Sweep up dust, shavings, and debris immediately after use.  
- Do not leave power cords or trip hazards across walkways.  
- Dispose of waste in the proper bins (metals, plastics, scrap wood, etc.). 
  > If it does not fit in any category, use the bin labeled "general waste".

---

## Materials & Consumables
- Store leftover materials in the proper racks, bins, or shelves.  
- Do not claim or hoard shared supplies—leave them available for all.  
- If you use the last of a shared consumable (sandpaper, glue, screws, etc.), note it on the supplies board or notify the group.  

---

## Safety & Hazardous Materials
- Clean spills immediately (oil, paint, resin, etc.).  
- Label any hazardous material you are storing.  
- Dispose of chemicals, solvents, and sharps according to posted rules.  

---

## Projects in Progress
- If leaving a project in the shop (with approval), store it neatly in the designated project storage area.  
- If the project takes multiple days to finish, store it in your member storage. If it does not fit there, then contact a member of the board to agree on a place to store it, and a rough duration for when you plan to finish it.
- Projects must be labeled with: name, contact information and start date.
- Clearly **label your project** with your name and date.  
- Projects left in unauthorized spaces may be moved or discarded.  

---

## End-of-Day Checklist
- Tools back in place  
- Surfaces wiped down  
- Floors swept  
- Trash emptied if full  
- Lights off and machines powered down  
- Back door must be locked

## Final Reminder
A clean workshop is safer, more productive, and more enjoyable for everyone. Following these rules is part of being a good member of the community.  
**Leave it better than you found it.**
